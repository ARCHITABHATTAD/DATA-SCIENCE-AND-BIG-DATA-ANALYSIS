Provide summary statistics (mean, median,
minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for a
dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the
qualitative (categorical) variable.
For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and quantitative variable
is income, then provide summary
statistics of income grouped by the
age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to
the categorical variable.

Virus dataset

The research center asked Dr. Han’s data mining lab to analyze the result. They asked how to use the two
medicines to fight with V1-virus.
Please follow the analysis guideline below and draw a conclusion:
1. Take the V1-Virus measures of the above 40 records and partition them into 5 bins by each of the
following methods
a. Equal-width partitioning

b. Equal-depth (equal-frequency) partitioning
2. Separate the 40 patients into two groups based on the analysis 1 (partitioning), where one group
has much lower V1-virus than the other, and further analyze the two groups by the following
methods
a. Compute the mean, Q1, median, Q3, and standard deviation of the T-virus measures for
each group
b. Draw the boxplots of the T-virus measures for each group
c. Normalize the Anti-A and Anti-B amounts based on the min-max normalization for each
group, and write down all normalized values
d. Draw scatter plots of the normalized Anti-A and normalized Anti-B for each group
e. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the normalized Anti-A and
normalized Anti-B for each group
f. Based on the analysis (a) – (e), draw a conclusion of how to use the two medicines to
fight with T-virus.
